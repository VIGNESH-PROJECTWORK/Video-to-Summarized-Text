# Video to Summarized Text

## Overview

Video to Summarized Text is a project aimed at automatically generating textual summaries from video content. The project utilizes speech recognition and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to transcribe spoken words from videos into text and then condense the text into concise summaries.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the Video to Summarized Text model consists of a collection of videos across various domains. Each video is accompanied by manually-generated textual summaries that serve as ground truth for evaluation.

## Technologies Used

- Speech Recognition APIs (e.g., Google Speech-to-Text, IBM Watson Speech to Text)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) Libraries (e.g., NLTK, SpaCy)
- Machine Learning Algorithms (e.g., TextRank, LSA, LDA)

## Usage

To use the Video to Summarized Text model:

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/VIGNESH-PROJECTWORK/Video-to-Summarized-Text.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd Video-to-Summarized-Text

3. Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the main script:

python video_to_text_summarization.py

Follow the instructions provided to input a video file and generate a summarized text output.

## Results

The performance of the Video to Summarized Text model is evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, coherence, and relevance of generated summaries compared to ground truth summaries. The results are presented in the project report along with qualitative assessments and examples.
